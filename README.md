This is my project aimed at creating, storing, deleting, and searching mobile contacts.

I developed a web application from scratch using modern technologies in this project. The application allows users to manage their contacts effectively. Key features include:

Contact Creation: Users can add new contacts with details such as name, phone number, email, etc.

Contact Storage: Contacts are stored securely in a database, ensuring data persistence.

Contact Deletion: Users can delete contacts they no longer need, with appropriate confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletions.

Contact Search: Implemented a functionality enabling users to quickly find specific contacts based on name, phone number, or other attributes.

Technologies used:

Frontend: Developed using React.js for dynamic user interfaces and a responsive design that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
Backend: Built with Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests, manage data storage in a relational database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL), and ensure secure operations.
Database: Employed PostgreSQL for robust and efficient data storage and retrieval.
Overall, this project demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack development, encompassing frontend design and backend functionality to create a practical and user-friendly solution for managing mobile contacts.
